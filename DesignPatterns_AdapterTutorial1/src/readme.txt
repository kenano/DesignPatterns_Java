Adapter's are used so a client can communicate with a legacy implementation.

1. Lets say there is an existing interface (Employee) and a class which implements it (EmployeeDB). We can add instances
of EmployeeDB to a collection of Employee's.

2. If we want to add objects that do not implement Employee to a collection of Employee's, we need an adapter.
